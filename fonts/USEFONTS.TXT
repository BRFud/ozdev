To use the fonts, simply upload Fonts.wzd to your organizer.  Then,
upload one of the font packages with extension .wzd in the SAMPLES directory
(look at the README.TXT files there for attributions) and run Fonts.  You
can load fonts into one of two slots.  MemoEdit will support both slots.
You can also access fonts in .wzf format from WizBookConverter--press the
OPTIONS button.
