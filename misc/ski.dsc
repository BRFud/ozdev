It is recommended you back up your Wizard before running C/assembler programs.
NOTE: If a C/assembly program hangs due to a bug, you may need to flip the battery switch on the bottom of the Wizard back and forth.  If the Wizard does not respond to this, taking the batteries out for half a minute should help.  If this doesn't help, you've read the WARNING above.  None of this should be necessary, but no guarantees are made.
