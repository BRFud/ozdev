Herea are two PC-based tool to size text in each of the Wizard's fonts.
(The program maketabl.c was run on the Wizard to send table.c to the
serial port which should be captured.)

1. SIZER

To use, run:
        sizer [width]
Then type in the text line by line.  You'll be told for each of the four
Wizard fonts what the text width is, and what x-coordinate to print the
text at to get it centered or right aligned.  When done, press ctrl-z.

Use this instead of ozputs(0,-1,s) for constant length strings for
efficiency.

Specify the width to get centering relative to a smaller width, e.g.,
for two centered columns.

2. WRAPPER

To use, run:
        wrapper [font [width]]
where the optional font parameter can be pcnormal (default), oznormal,
pclarge or ozlarge.  The width is the desired screen width; default is
239.  If you specify width, you must specify font.  Then input text (or
use < to feed it from a file).

The output will be the text wrapped to fit on the Wizard's display.
Press ctrl-z when done.

3. Rotfont, etc.

This is miscellaneous stuff used to grab fonts from the Wizard and
generate a table of rotated fonts.
