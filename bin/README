MAKEWZD creates a Wizard file from a .bin file created by Hi-Tech's
linker.  Run MAKEWZD with no arguments for instructions.  You can use
icon "data files" (not bitmaps) saved from the latest release of zifnab.

OZLINK filename1 [filename2 [filename3 [...]]]
         Links filename1.obj and all other specified files to create
         filename1.bin and filename1.wzd.  Filename1 must NOT have
         any extension, but the other filenames MUST.  To link the
         floating point library, include libf.lib.  LIBOZ and LIBC
         and startup code are included by default.  WARNING: if the
         program is longer than 16k (see filename1.map: do not rely
         on file length as the BSS segment is not added to the file
         length) or if filename1.map indicates that the lowpage segment
         extends beyond 9FFF, the program won't work.

MINIOPT is a miniature peephole optimizer for zxc -s output.  Use when
         zxc runs out of memory.

CHECKSYM checks some assertions about symbol locations.
