What the Heck Is This?

Err, it was a single font, now it's whole font-family.

C'mon, you stupid xxxx, tell me some more!

Ok, it's a really small, but useable font. I came from the amiga and several other systems. I was really knee-deep in the real pixels. I know what pixels are, and I know what amount of information they can carry, if you let'em.
So I was always pissed about the way, user-Interfaces grew and grew (in pixel-sizes). No new functions, but everthing is getting bigger and bigger, your screen is filled with boring designed windows and oversized requesters'n'stuff.
I said to me, THAT IS CRAP ! I developed a smaller GUI, (which will be functional some day.. see my site, If you are interested, contact me!), and, of course, a smaller font (for the new GUI).
This is that font. The Smitholution Font. It saves space, looks good, and uses only pixels if it's absolutely necessary. If you disagree about that, do it better or die. ;-)

I have to add: Some people have weak eyes or fuzzy hongkong monitors (or both) and say: "Oh, that's too small... I can't read a thing!" ... Those kind of poeple can use BIG blurry anti-aliased fonts and waste their screen-space.



HOW TO USE

How Do I Install the Smitholution Font?

Just drag the suitcases you want to use onto your system folder icon. The Finder will ask you if you want to put it in your fonts folder, where it belongs. Click OK. That’s all.
Use the Appearance Control Panel (or similar in 7.x) to choose the font for List-Views etc.



SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Any Mac running System 7 or higher, with approx. 50 KB free on Hard Disk.
Maybe you can use this font with older systems, but I haven't tested that yet.
Anyone want to test it ?



FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

 Q: Have you plans creating a vector-version of Smitholution Font ?
 A: Maybe... Contact me, if you know an easy way.
 
 Q: Will there be different versions of Smitholution Font ?
 A: Yes, there are various versions included in this release: 
    Roman, Bold, Capitals, Caps Bold, Fixed-Width, Ultra-Condensed 
    and Menu-Font plus Menu Condensed 12pt. etc. etc.

 Q: What is planned for the next releases ?
 A: Hmm, good question. I just want complete world domination by creating the
    best optimized bitmap-fonts for desktop-use ! I also want a new GUI-Style.

 Q: What about Mac OS X?
 A: I don't know much about adding new fonts AND I don't know about bitmap-fonts in OS X,
    I fear apple hasn't thought about it, I heard you can't disable those anti-aliasing.
    Anyway, OS X is far away from being a full featured system... Stay tuned.
    If you are a UNIX-Pro and can convert my fonts to UNIX'ish OSes (e.g. Linux, MacOS X,
    BSD, etc.) please contact me.

 Q: What about other Operating Systems ?
 A: I am looking forward to any conversion of my fonts. If you are interested in the fonts for Windows,
    Atari-OS (:-), Amiga-OS, BeOS or anything else, please contact me, maybe we can find a solution...

 Q: What about the numbers in the font-names ?
 A: These are the ID-Numbers of the fonts.

 Q: How to use the fonts ?
 A: Very important ! Use most of them at 9 pt, some are made in 12pt. (The Menu-Series)
    These fonts will only look good in their native size or double or triple...
    If you are unsure, look inside the font-suitcases and you'll see the native size... 9 or 12.. Have fun !

KNOWN BUGS

Spacing when using these fonts for menus (e.g. with Appearance Hopper) is not correct, due to a bug in NFNT-Editor. Will be fixed very soon, I hope.

Note: A special bundle of Smithz is included with Appearance Hopper from Weedhopper Press. These fonts are fixed by hand, they work fine. Big thanks to Jeremiah Morris from Weedhopper Press.

DISCLAIMER

Smithz Font is copyright 1999-2001 by Smitholution Entertainment International. All rights reserved.

Please don't alter the font and upload it somewhere under its original name.
If you wan't to create a custom bitmap-font, I highly recommend NFNT-Edtitor from Pandawave. Or try Macromedia Fontographer which is overpowered, expensive and slow.
