The font Hebrew.WRF is based on the BeerScheba Palm Pilot font by
Michael Neuhold. The original font came with the Gnu Public License.
However, since bitmapped fonts are not copyrightable in the U.S., the
Gnu Public License may not be valid.  If it is, you must abide by it--
see: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

Source code for the Hebrew.WRF font can be obtained by renaming it to
hebrew.wzf, and running wzf2txt on it (get the Hi-Tech C SDK from
www.ozdev.com).

The HebrewSans.WRF font is based on a Hebrew block font for the Palm
Pilot that I downloaded from www.zalman.org
