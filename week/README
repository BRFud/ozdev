VIEWWEEK Program

My gratitude is due to Giancarlo Gastaldello for translating into Italian.
To compile for Italian, change #define ENGLISH to #define ITALIAN in
viewweek.h, and change viewweek.dsc to italian.dsc in Makefile.


NOTE: If you compile the version here, the forceautorun option won't
work.  That option requires a separate module, ozsetaut.obj, that for
security reasons is not included with the Hi-Tech C distribution, and is
replaced by a safe non-working version.  If you make changes to viewweek
and want forceautorun functionality, email pruss@imap.pitt.edu for a
recompiled version with your changes.
