makewzd [-ownerid] filename [Title [("Description" | @descfile) [iconfile]]]
or: makewzd [-ownerid] filename @info

        This command creates a filename.wzd file given a filename.bin
        file, allowing one to specify a title that shows up in the
        Wizard's My Programs menu, a description that shows up in the
        downloader, an icon and an ownerid (needed if you use the
        C-based file system).

        If the title is not specified, the input filename is used.  If
        the description is not specified, the title is copied into it.
        If the icon is not specified, a default "C" icon is supplied.
        If the ownerid is not specified, 65535 is supplied.

        If the title contains spaces, it should be surrounded by
        quotation marks ("...").

        The description can either be given on the command line between
        quotation marks, or one can specify @descfile which will load
        the description from descfile.  The descfile should be broken up
        into paragraphs by inserting an additional completely empty line
        (with no spaces on the blank line) between paragraphs.

        The iconfile is a binary icon file produced by zifnab.  (See
        www.ozdev.com.)

        Alternately, all the arguments other than the ownerid and
        filename may be taken from the file info.  The file info is a
        text file formatted precisely as follows:
Line 1: Title
Line 2: One character specifying what character indicates white in lines 3-13
Lines 3-13: The first 12 characters of each line give the icon in text format
Lines 14 on: Description

        Lines 2-13 may contain additional junk (e.g., line numbers,
        comments, etc.) after the icon information, which will be
        ignored, but the lines cannot be more than 80 characters or else
        makewzd may fail.  The icon is in lines 3-13 is 12x12 and
        specified by a bitmap represented as text, with zero (white)
        being represented by the character given in line 2, and any
        other character representing black.

        For instance, here is a valid info file:
Sample Title
.             0
.xxxxxxxxxx.  1
x..........x  2
x.xxxxxxxx.x  3
x..........x  4
x.xxxxxxx..x  5
x..........x  6
x..........x  7
.xxxxxxxxxx.  8
x.x.x.x.x.xx  9
xx.x.x.x.x.x 10
x.x.x.x.x.xx 11
.xxxxxxxxxx. 12

        The numbers at the ends of lines 2-13 are ignored but are
        helpful for laying things out.  Any character other than '.'
        could be used in the icon to indicate black pixels--the icon
        could just as well have been given as:
Sample Title
.             0
.abcdefghij.  1
l..........m  2
n.        .o  3
x..........x  4
#.$^*&@&@..x  5
x..........x  6
x..........x  7
.xffa  fffx.  8
x.x.x.x.x.xx  9
xx.x.x.x.x.x 10
x.x.x.x.x.xx 11
.xxxxxxxxxx. 12

        Note that in this example, space counts as black, because it is
        different from '.'.  If one wanted space to be white instead of
        '.', one would put a single space in the second line of the
        file.  One has to be careful because some text editors may not
        save spaces at the end of a line, and so one may have to insert
        something after the space to keep the text editor from
        swallowing it up--makewzd will ignore it.  So, we could also do:
Sample Title
              0
 xxxxxxxxxx   1
x          x  2
x xxxxxxxx x  3
x          x  4
x.xxxxxxx  x  5
x          x  6
x          x  7
 xxxxxxxxxx   8
x x x x x xx  9
xx x x x x x 10
x x x x x xx 11
 xxxxxxxxxx  12

        The icon is easiest designed in a text editor with a fixed-width
        font (e.g., Courier) in overtype mode.
