BY DOWNLOADING YOU SIGNIFY YOU HAVE READ AND AGREED TO ALL OF THE
CONDITIONS LISTED HERE.  This is a C/assembly program.  It is possible
for a C/assembly program to damage data and even to make your organizer
inoperable.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  NO GUARANTEES ARE MADE. By
downloading this program to your organizer you agree not to hold the
author(s) responsible for any damage to data, hardware or anything else.

IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ARE
NOT LEGALLY PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD OR USE THE PROGRAM. This program may
be freely distributed but only provided that this description is
unmodified.  This program is copyright (c) 2001-2002 Alexander R Pruss.



It is strongly recommended you back up your Wizard before running
C/assembler programs.



NOTE: If a C/assembly program hangs due to a bug, you may need to flip
the battery switch on the bottom of the Wizard back and forth.  If the
Wizard does not respond to this, taking the batteries out for half a
minute should help.  If this doesn't help, you've read the WARNING
above.  None of this should be necessary, but no guarantees are made.

This program may not have been sufficiently tested.  Report bugs and
suggestions to: ap85@georgetown.edu.

NOTE: Any alarms going off while program is running will be missed.


This is a simple e-book reader.  The converter for it needs as input is
standard ASCII text with a blank line between paragraphs, and compresses
the text down by about 49% by the time the data gets into the computer.
To use it, double click on the WizBookConverter program and then click
on the red book to open a book text.  When prompted for the name of the
Wizard file, enter the name without any extension.  Any file by that
name (with no extension) in the directory in which the book text is
found will be overwritten, as will also be that file with extension .wzd.
The filename will be shown on the Wizard, and cannot exceed 20 characters.
Longer names will cause errors in transmission.

When it's done, WizBookConverter will launch the Wizard downloader if
the Wizard downloader is installed.  If the Wizard downloader is not
installed, you will have to upload the .wzd file manually.  You must then
run WizBook immediately before downloading any further e-books.  Downloading
more than one e-book at a time can cause a bunch of junk memo entries and an
incomplete file.


The converter first compresses your file, and then converts to a
sequence of memos dated in the year 2020.  If there is trouble somewhere
in the process, you may need to delete all these memos.


In WizBook, use PageUp/PageDown and the up and down arrow keys to view the
file.  You can also use the space bar, the enter keys, the return key, the
A and Z keys, and the - key for navigation.  Press 2nd-pageup to go to
the top and 2nd-pagedown to go to the bottom. Press M to set a bookmark (you
can have up to 50 of them). Press B to go to the last set bookmark (then
B to go to the previous bookmark--and so on for a couple of bookmarks).
Press V to view bookmarks (ESC to exit viewing, ENTER to select, DEL to
delete, C to clear all, PageUp/PageDown/Up/Down to browse).  When you
exit WizBook, your current viewing position and bookmark will be saved.
Press C to clear all bookmarks. Press L to change line spacing (this
will be saved in the bookmark file).  Press the MENU key or H for a bit
of help.  Press I for some information on where you are in the ebook.
Press shift-PageUp (or shift-up) / shift-PageDown (or shift-down) to
move by 10% of the file. Press shift-minus or 2nd-minus to control the
key click.  Press R to toggle the progress bar.

Press N/P to move forward/backwards a chapter at a time (assuming a
table of contents has been created).

There is a word search feature.  Press S or D and enter a sequence of up to
six words and/or numbers (using only the characters a-z and 0-9), separated
by spaces to search from the beginning (if you press S) or from the current
position (if you press D). All extended characters are treated as "xx"
when searching. This searches for the first paragraph that contains all
of the words. To search for any word beginning with a given sequence of
characters, put a period after the sequence.  Thus, the search string
"bit. have" searches for all paragraphs containing the word "have" and
any word like "bit", "bits", "bitten", "bite", "bitter", etc.  All
searches are case insensitive, so "have" also matches "hAve" and "Have".
Press G to search again with the same search string.  The S key searches
from the beginning.  If pressing S or D gives you a highlighted search
string, press enter or return to search with this string, right arrow to
edit this string, or any other key to enter a new string, replacing the
old.  Press ESC to clear the currently entered search string, and ESC again
to abort searching.  If you prefix all of the search string with -, only
the first line of each paragraph is search.  This is handy if your file, say,
contains some header line at the front of each paragraph.

If you press shift-S or shift-D, your search results are not shown on
screen but are saved to the bookmarks list, where they can be viewed
with a V. Only one search result per paragraph is stored. It is
recommended that you clear the bookmarks list before doing this so
you do not run out of space.
  
You can press ESC to stop searching.  This does not react instantly.  Do
NOT press ESC more than once, or you'll get out of WizBook.

WizBookConverter can generate a table of contents.  If it has too many
entries, file compression will suffer.  This is done by going to the
OPTIONS page and entering the initial characters in those paragraphs
that are supposed to form the headers of table of contents entries.
For instance, one can enter "CHAPTER" (this is case sensitive) to put
in the table of contents all paragraphs starting with the word CHAPTER.
Or one can use a special character like ~ for this purpose.  Currently,
this is incompatible with the Cyrillic option.  To view the table of
contents of a file, press T in WizBook.  Press ESC to exit the table
of contents, ENTER to go to an entry, PageUp/PageDown/Up/Down to browse.

WizBookConverter has a special "dictionary" option.  What this does is
it pairs of neighboring paragraphs into one, but keeping a line break
between them.  This is useful so that you can produce a dictionary.  For
instance:

aardvark

Definition of an aardvark
goes right here.

abacus

And here comes the defintion
of an abacus.

WizBookConverter then produces an output where "aardvark" and its definition
are one paragraph, but aardvark is still on a line by itself.  Likewise,
"abacus" and its definition are one paragraph, but abacus is still on a
line by itself.  Why would you want to do this?  Well, you can then use
the - prefix to search just the first line of each paragraph, which is handy
for dictionary lookups.  You can search for "-aardvark" and it will search
only the paragraph headings, not the rest of the paragraphs.  This is faster
than searching the whole of the paragraph, and won't find paragraphs where
"aardvark" is part of the definiens rather than of the definiendum.

Press F to toggle the full-screen scrolling option (whether the bottom line
becomes the first line of the next screen or not when scrolling forward,
and whether the top line becomes the bottom line of the next screen when
scrolling backwards).


WizBook is KeyTune compatible.  You can get KeyTune from home.att.net/~apruss
and adjust keyboard repeat rates and power saving options with it.


Instead of using WizBookConverter, the advanced user can use prepare.bat.  The
usage is: prepare inputname.ext outputname (with no extension on outputname).



You may need to download the Visual Basic runtime files from
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp4/win98/EN-US/VBRun60sp4.exe
if WizBookConverter reports a missing DLL file.


WizBookConverter by default assumes you are inputting ASCII files where
paragraphs are separated by completely blank lines.  The other possible
format is that paragraphs start with a space or tab at the beginning of
the line, and you can select this format from the File | Properties
dialog. In that dialog, you can also choose to indent output paragraphs.
This will increase the size of the file in proportion to how much you
output paragraphs.  Some other options are settable there.  For instance,
you can choose to use the pretty "Alpha-BK" font.  You can also load in
an alternate font in .wzf or .wrf format--you can download more fonts on
home.att.net/~apruss .  The .wrf format fonts are for right-to-left scripts,
such as Hebrew.  Right-to-left texts are fully supported by WizBook.  There
is no difference between a .wzf and a .wrf font--the extension is just a
signal to the converter whether to set the right-to-left flag on or not.

The "Alpha-BK" font is by Rainer Zenz (www.rainerzenz.de/palm).
You can also load in Cyrillic texts in Windows CP1251 or KOI8-R
encoding.  Any Roman characters in those texts will be transliterated to
Cyrillic.  This requires a Wizard Cyrillic font.  This package includes
two of them--vprus.wzf and malij.wzf--and you can make more with the
Font Package at home.att.net/~apruss.

A Polish font based on Alpha-BK is in alpha_pl.wzf.  It is compatible
with texts in ISO Central European and Windows Central European encodings
but supports only the Polish subset.  Just turn on extended characters in
WizBookConverter and set it to prompt for a font.


Do NOT put the same output filename as the input filename in WizBookConverter,
or it may destroy your input file and create a junk output file.



NOTE 1: Ideally, your e-books should be stored in the "wb/" directory on the
Organizer if you use tomemo manually.  The bookmarks are normally stored
in the "bm/" directory, with the same filename as the e-book's, but no
bookmarks will stored for e-books not in the "wb/" directory.


NOTE 2:
Data is stored in special schedule entries dated January 1,
1901.  Do not modify these schedule entries yourself, but if you want to
delete a file, feel free to delete all the schedule entries with that
filename in the description--generally, because of certain limits, a
given program is stored in more than one schedule entry.  You may
occasionally experience problems synchronizing these schedule entries
with DayTimer.  The program data inside these entries is NOT
synchronized with DayTimer;  only the labels are.  If you delete WizBook,
you will need to delete these schedule entries manually.  (Or, you can
use the DELETE ALL option in WizBook before getting rid of WizBook.)


NOTE 3:
While Wizbook integrates FromMemo capabilities, it only supports FromMemo
version 2 files, which is what the WizBookConverter creates.  If you use
FromMemo version 1 files, you will need to run a different FromMemo importer,
such as the original FromMemo on mywizard.com, or the one integrated into
the Font Package.
