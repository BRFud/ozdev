BY DOWNLOADING YOU SIGNIFY YOU HAVE READ AND AGREED TO ALL OF THE
CONDITIONS LISTED HERE.  This is a C/assembly program.  It is possible
for a C/assembly program to damage data and even to make your organizer
inoperable.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  NO GUARANTEES ARE MADE. By
downloading this program to your organizer you agree not to hold the
author(s) responsible for any damage to data, hardware or anything else.

IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ARE
NOT LEGALLY PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD OR USE THE PROGRAM. This program may
be freely distributed but only provided that this description is
unmodified.  This program is copyright (c) 2001-2002 Alexander R Pruss.



It is strongly recommended you back up your Wizard before running
C/assembler programs.



NOTE: If a C/assembly program hangs due to a bug, you may need to flip
the battery switch on the bottom of the Wizard back and forth.  If the
Wizard does not respond to this, taking the batteries out for half a
minute should help.  If this doesn't help, you've read the WARNING
above.  None of this should be necessary, but no guarantees are made.

This program may not have been sufficiently tested.  Report bugs and
suggestions to: ap85@georgetown.edu.

NOTE: Any alarms going off while program is running will be missed.


This is a simple e-book reader.  The converter for it needs as input is
standard ASCII text with a blank line between paragraphs, and compresses
the text down by about 49% by the time the data gets into the computer.
To use it, double click on the WizBookConverter program and then click
on the red book to open a book text.  When prompted for the name of the
Wizard file, enter the name without any extension.  Any file by that
name (with no extension) in the directory in which the book text is
found will be overwritten, as will also be that file with extension .wzd.
The filename will be shown on the Wizard, and cannot exceed 20 characters.
Longer names will cause errors in transmission.

When it's done, WizBookConverter will launch the Wizard downloader if
the Wizard downloader is installed.  If the Wizard downloader is not
installed, you will have to upload the .wzd file manually.  You must then
run WizBook immediately before downloading any further e-books.  Downloading
more than one e-book at a time can cause a bunch of junk memo entries and an
incomplete file.


The converter first compresses your file, and then converts to a
sequence of memos dated in the year 2020.  If there is trouble somewhere
in the process, you may need to delete all these memos.


In WizBook, use PageUp/PageDown and the up and down arrow keys to view the
file.  You can also use the space bar, the enter keys, the return key and the
- key for navigation.  Press 2nd-pageup to go to the top and
2nd-pagedown to go to the bottom. Press M to set a bookmark.  Press B to
go to the last set bookmark (then B to go to the previous bookmark--and
so on for a couple of bookmarks).  When you exit, your current viewing
position and bookmark will be saved.  Press C to clear all bookmarks.
Press S to change line spacing (this will be saved in the bookmark
file).  Press the MENU key or H for a bit of help.  Press I for some
information on where you are in the ebook.  Press shift-PageUp (or
shift-up) / shift-PageDown (or shift-down) to move by 10% of the file.
Press shift-minus or 2nd-minus to control the key click.  Press R to
toggle the progress bar.


WizBook is KeyTune compatible.  You can get KeyTune from home.att.net/~apruss
and adjust keyboard repeat rates with it.


Instead of using WizBookConverter, the advanced user can use prepare.bat.  The
usage is: prepare inputname.ext outputname (with no extension on outputname).



You may need to download the Visual Basic runtime files from
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp4/win98/EN-US/VBRun60sp4.exe
if WizBookConverter reports a missing DLL file.


WizBookConverter by default assumes you are inputting ASCII files where
paragraphs are separated by completely blank lines.  The other possible
format is that paragraphs start with a space or tab at the beginning of
the line, and you can select this format from the File | Properties
dialog. In that dialog, you can also choose to indent output paragraphs.
This will increase the size of the file in proportion to how much you
output paragraphs.  Some other options are settable there.  For instance,
you can choose to use the pretty "Alpha-BK" font.  You can also load in
an alternate font in .wzf format--you can download more fonts on
home.att.net/~apruss The "Alpha-BK" font is by Rainer Zenz
(www.rainerzenz.de/palm).  You can also load in Cyrillic texts in Windows
CP1251 or KOI8-R encoding.  Any Roman characters in those texts will be
transliterated to Cyrillic.  This requires a Wizard Cyrillic font.  This
package includes two of them--vprus.wzf and malij.wzf--and you can make more
with the Font Package at home.att.net/~apruss.



NOTE 1: Ideally, your e-books should be stored in the "wb/" directory on the
Organizer if you use tomemo manually.  The bookmarks are normally stored
in the "bm/" directory, with the same filename as the e-book's, but no
bookmarks will stored for e-books not in the "wb/" directory.


NOTE 2:
Data is stored in special schedule entries dated January 1,
1901.  Do not modify these schedule entries yourself, but if you want to
delete a file, feel free to delete all the schedule entries with that
filename in the description--generally, because of certain limits, a
given program is stored in more than one schedule entry.  You may
occasionally experience problems synchronizing these schedule entries
with DayTimer.  The program data inside these entries is NOT
synchronized with DayTimer;  only the labels are.  If you delete WizBook,
you will need to delete these schedule entries manually.  (Or, you can
use the DELETE ALL option in WizBook before getting rid of WizBook.)


TECHNICAL INFORMATION: This program is written in Hi-Tech C, with some
assembly bits for i/o.
