BY DOWNLOADING YOU SIGNIFY YOU HAVE READ AND AGREED TO ALL OF THE CONDITIONS LISTED HERE.  This is a C/assembly program.  It is possible for a C/assembly program to damage data and even to make your organizer inoperable.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  NO GUARANTEES ARE MADE. By downloading this program to your organizer you agree not to hold the author(s) responsible for any damage to data, hardware or anything else. IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ARE NOT LEGALLY PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD OR USE THE PROGRAM. This program may be freely distributed but only provided that this description is unmodified.  Most of this program is copyright (c) 2000 Alexander R Pruss.
It is recommended you back up your Wizard before running C/assembler programs.
NOTE: If a C/assembly program hangs due to a bug, you may need to flip the battery switch on the bottom of the Wizard back and forth.  If the Wizard does not respond to this, taking the batteries out for half a minute should help.  If this doesn't help, you've read the WARNING above.  None of this should be necessary, but no guarantees are made.
This program has NOT been tested very much.  Report bugs and suggestions to: pruss@imap.pitt.edu.
BASIC INSTRUCTIONS: Start Hyperterm (or another terminal emulator) on your PC, configuring it for 9600 baud, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and whatever COMx port your Wizard is on.  (You can also use 19200 or 38400 baud if you have a good connection.)  Start a text capture in Hyperterm.  Run DUMPERAS and choose what data to dump and at what baud rate.  Stop the capture, and in the captured file you should have much of the erased data that was on your Wizard, though not all.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION: This program is written in Hi-Tech C, with some assembly bits for i/o.  Source code is available in the latest Wizard Hi-Tech C distribution on www.ozdev.com under "win32 downloads".
