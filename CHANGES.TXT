backwards compatibility and force programmers to change old code, or that
are important for some other reason.

07-10-03: 1.01 release

         Fixed bug in putchar() and ozeditline(). [LC]

         Fixed documentation of ozenterisreturn().

         Fixed some typos in liboz.txt. [SPJ]

01-07-03: 1.00 release

         Documented ozgetnextfilename().

         Added tell1() and lseek1set().

         Added ozenterisreturn() to documentation.

         Added Hebrew font.  Foreign fonts in fonts\samples now include
         Hebrew, Polish and Russian.

         Small update to ozpack. [LC]

         The privacy fixes also restore proper functionality according
         to which an assembly defs statement with non-defs statements
         after it generates zeros, as per manual.

         ****Added a workaround for Pacific C's HLINK linker's privacy
         problem. Just run HLIN1.EXE instead of HLINK.EXE, making sure
         HLINK.EXE is in the same directory as HLIN1.EXE.  If you've
         installed HLINK.EXE via the INSTP batch file, you will need to
         run INSTP again to install the privacy fix.

         ****Because of the privacy problems plaguing previous releases
         (data from your computer--possibly private data--could have
         been included in executables), it is recommended you recompile or
         at least re-link all old code.  One exception so far checked is
         that everything was probably working just fine under Windows XP, so
         if you compiled under WinXP before, no action is required.

         ****Removed a privacy problem from the Z80 Hi-Tech C linker.  This
         was capable of including randomly selected data from your
         computer's memory in your executable.  [LC]

         Sped up crc code by factor of four.  [LC]

         ozgetch() can now trap KEY_POWER if power key handling is disabled.
         See docs\liboz.txt.

         Fixed bug in ozputs().  There used to be trouble in displaying
         eight-pixel-width characters on a non-white background, and
         always an unnecessary pixel column would be cleared after each
         character.

         Fixed(?) cursor height in ozeditline() and ozgreyeditline().

         REALLY added new version of zcc.

         ozinstallmemorywiper() documented.

7-13-02: 0.100

         Fixed bug in _ozputsprite() and added __ozputsprite().

         New version of zcc.  Now if you use any of the -z* flags, you
         don't need to have the -z flag.  Thus, zcc -zs hello.c works.
         [LC]

         Added information on locating the latest release of djgpp to
         readme.txt as per djgpp license.

         Support for ozpack.  See docs\ozpack.txt.  Ozpack allows one
         to compress .wzd program files.  [LC]

         Optimized ozsetisr().  Alas, using a combination of both
         ozsetisr() and _ozsetisr() will take a little more memory than
         it used to, but rarely will a program need to do that.

         Optimized model detection code and fixed a copyright problem.

         Included ozmemo.h in oz.h.

         Fixed a bug in the sample data memo code.

         Fixed bug in miniopt2 optimizer.  The bug was in processing
         some arrays of pre-initialized pointers.

         **** The 64hz timer is no longer running all the time
         by default, in order to conserve battery power.  It runs for a
         short time after each keystroke, but that's all.  If you were
         using _oz64hz_word or _oz64hz_dword for timing things, you must
         now call oz64hztimeron() before doing this.  A well-behaved
         program will restore the 64hz timer status afterwards, too, to
         conserve battery power--you'll want to use oz64hztimeroff()
         afterwards.

         **** Standard ozgetch() and getch() now have screen blanker
         functionality built in.  If you don't like this, you can always
         turn it off or use _ozgetch().

         The screen blanker inside ozgetchblank() is now more energy
         efficient.  In fact, if all is working, then the Wizard uses
         about as much battery power with the screen blanked as with the
         power off, unless you have explicitly activated the 64hz timer.

         Modified the units for measuring the blank/power-off times for
         ozgetchblank().  Now these are measured in seconds.

         Added a 16-bit 1hz timer that runs all the time: _oz1hz.

         **** Modified legal range for key repeat/delay speeds to
         between 1 and 254.  If you were using speeds 0 or 255 before,
         you might have trouble now.

         Added getprcfont program for converting Palm font resources.
         See DOCS\FONTS.TXT

5-25-02: 0.092

         Added convenient font2wzd batch file.

         Made font2wiz and getmacfont work with more fonts.

5-22-02: 0.091

         Fixed major bug in ozputs() and ozputch() introduced in 0.090.

5-20-02: 0.090

         Added custom font support.  See docs\fonts.txt, and also
         docs\liboz.txt Section 1.2.1.  There are all sorts of font
         conversion programs in the FONTS directory, as well as a
         font browser.

         License changed slightly: some file system utilizing programs
         are exempted from the requirement to apply for an owner ID.

         KeyTune-type of stuff has been changed for the 750.  All
         applications using ozsavekeysettings() and
         ozrestorekeysettings() need to be recompiled and users need
         to be directed to the new version of KeyTune.

         Did some work on a privacy issue in zxcc (random memory could
         get output to zxc output files).

         New version of tomemo--produces much smaller files but needs
         new frommemo.wzd (in FILE directory).

         Add ozscrollleft() and ozscrollright().  [LC]

         Optimized getch() slightly and reduced power consumption for it.

         Slightly optimized file i/o routines hash function.

3-16-02: 0.082

         Updated zcc to 1.01.  [LC]

3-16-02: 0.081

         Included somewhat updated version of zcc.  Should work on
         Windows 2000.  [LC]

         Added 3D library in 3D\.  [MH, some changes by ARP]

         Fixed bug in read().

         Added print option to checksym.

         Added overflow checking to exp().

         Included Carey Bloodworth's ARCHESS program, ported for the Wizard.

         Added ozsnap() to send a screen snapshot to the PC.  [BG]

         Added some shift optimization to miniopt. Fixed bugs in
         miniopt0 and miniopt.  Improved quality of optimization in
         miniopt2--now converts more static variables to self-modifying
         code than before.

         Made floating point sprintf() longer but now it handles %g much
         better.

         Replaced "unlinkallowned" with "ozunlinkallowned" in docs\liboz.txt.

         Optimized ozmenu(), _ozline(), atof(), sqrt(), log(), sin(), exp(),
         pow(), sinh(), cosh(), tanh().

         Recompiled floating point library with minioptf.

         Added minioptf to the miniopt package.  This slightly improves
         the precision of floating point constants, optimizes floating
         point constants in code (the Hi-Tech C compiler handles floating
         point rather poorly), and gets around a bug in the Hi-Tech C
         compiler in handling very long floating point constants.

         Included zcc.h and czcc.bat (for compiling).

2-15-02: 0.080

         Included zcc, a highly improved command-line shell for the
         compiler, with better memory usage, more features, etc.  It is
         highly recommended that zcc be used instead of zxc henceforth
         by all programmers whenever reasonably possible.  See DOCS\ZCC.TXT
         for more information on zcc.  [LC]

         Optimized fabs().

         Fixed (?) in libsrc\gen\frelop.as which caused bugs in comparison
         of negative floating point numbers.

         Optimized floating point routines at cost of making them
         non-reentrant.  The original math library is still available as
         libf-norm.lib.

         Added some error trapping to floating point routines.  Whenever
         an error occurs in a floating point routine, the unsigned char
         variable __fperr (declared in math.h) is set to 1.  To check if
         an error occurs in a calculation, set __fperr=0 before the
         calculation, and test it afterwards.

         Added scrolling indicators to ozmenu() and fixed PageUp code.

         Fixed bug in ozeditline().

         Implemented alloca(), though it only works with zcc -a, and
         needs #include <alloca.h>.  No stack overflow checking.

         Optimized ozkey.as, ozcls.as, ozcopy.as, 32k.as, oztime.as,
         ozfr.as, ozdetect.as.

         Included irrel, an irrelevant prototype remover from Minix,
         which is used by some compilation batch files and zcc.  [LC]

         Optimized many LIBOZ routines on assumption that they are
         called with a000 set to page 407 -- this assumption is now
         normative.

         Added warning to README.TXT about atexit()'s nine-call limit.

         Optimized ozputs() somewhat.

         Optimized the file1.c functions some more.

         Optimized atexit() and related functions.

         Removed automatic ozslow() call from de-init code--now it's
         only there if you've actually used ozfast() or ozblank().

         Made executable smaller for zxc, zxlibr and zxlink.

         Optimized zxcc some more, and made the executable smaller.  [LC]

         Optimized flash routines. [DR]

         Fixed a very rarely occurring (never observed) bug in ozintwait().

         Removed need for #include <ozmenu.h> and fixed a header bug
         involving ozmenu.h.

         Added oz*keysettings() for saving/restoring keyboard settings,
         and the KeyTune program in the KEY directory for manipulating
         these.  Not tested on 750 models.

         Added ozcrc16auxmem().

         Another 14% speedup in compiling (benchmark by ccopt0 edit.c in
         EDIT\) by using Multi-Z80 CPU emulator by Neil Bradley
         (neil@synthcom.com).  [LC]

         Added functions for easy storage of data in memos.  See same\io.c
         for an example.  See also the documentation in docs\liboz.txt.

         Fixed bug in how getch() functions in capslock mode.

         Made unlink(), unlinkallowned() and some other file routines
         more reliable.  Made some of these routines smaller and others
         larger.

         Put ozserial.h back into oz.h.

12-26-01: 0.074

         Fixed bug in the cached file i/o routines in FILE\CACHED.

         Removed warnings about ozputs() and file i/o routines not
         working on 7xxM models.

         Added ozputsor() and ozputchor().

         Fixed some bugs in flash routines. [DR]

         Modified unlink() a little.  Hope it'll still work.  It's now
         smaller.

         Changed documentation for unlink().

         Slight optimization to file i/o routine size.

         Fixed small bug in ozputs() and ozputch() that caused these
         routines to run out of screen space too soon.

         Added Same!, a clone of Mac/Unix SameGame.  In SAME\.

         Added ozkeydelay64hz().

         Fixed minor bugs in ozmenu().

         Fixed bug in ozrestorescreen().

         Finally fixed the backlight when writing/deleting files problem.

         Sped up compilation by about 1/3 or more by optimizing zxcc's
         Z80 emulator.

12-18-01: 0.073

         Changes made to license.  Please read it (it's in readme.txt)
         since by using the package, you agree with it.

         Modified things so that the 8086 native linker and librarian from
         Hi-Tech's Pacific C package works with this.  This speeds up
         compilation if one uses ozlink*.  For more information, see
         readme.txt and/or run INSTP.BAT.

         Added things like MASK2ND|KEY_LOWER_ENTER to getch().

         A test version of the MemoEdit editor is included in EDIT.

         Created bin\ccopt0.bat for (optimized) compiling of larger
         projects. Unfortunately, oz.h has grown so much that Hi-Tech C
         has started running out of memory (remember it runs within an
         emulated 64K space!)  To compile with a little bit more memory, run:
                ccopt0 filename
         (no extension).  Note that you'll need to edit bin\ccopt0.bat if
         your Hi-Tech C directory is not c:\progra~1\wiz\hitech.

         Fixed some non-standard stuff in some Hi-Tech C header files.

         Fixed(?) some bugs in ozsound() and key-click interaction.

         Fixed a very nasty bug in ozwriteauxmem() and ozreadauxmem()
         which would produce crashes when the length was divisible by
         256.

         Enabled keys like KEY_LEFT|MASKSHIFT in getch.c.

         Fixed some backlight problems.

         Officially added _ozputsprite() function. [BG, modified ARP]

         Added oz?etindexby() function.

         Changed data type in ozgetappindexlist() and documented it a
         little.

         Fixed source code for ozeditline() and ozgreyeditline() to
         allow compilation with latest version of oz.h.

         Added ozmenu() function for creating nice menus easily.

         Documented ozfarmemcpy() function.

         Added ozsavescreen() and ozrestorescreen() functions.

         Added fast _ozfilledbox() routine and made ozfilledbox()
         faster.  [LC]

         Added version number marker within 32k.as.

12-02-05: 0.072

         Fixed another ozwrite() bug.

         Discovered programs can crash (battery removal needed!) if power
         key is pressed while data is written.

12-02-02: 0.071

         Fixed a very major bug in the file i/o routines.  This bug
         precluded files of any type from being read on all 770 systems.

         Fixed a bug occurrent when running ViewWeek at almost exactly a
         certain time very close to midnight.  The likelihood you ever
         ran across this bug is miniscule.

12-02-01: 0.070

         Fixed a major bug in the oz*aux*() routines that caused
         incorrect data to be read or written to the auxiliary memory
         area.  All software compiled with oz*aux*() should be
         recompiled.  In particular, you should upgrade your version of
         pix.

         Makewzd has been overhauled.  It works almost as before, except
         now to split text into paragraphs in the description file, you
         need to insert a complete blank line between paragraphs.
         Moreover, makewzd now have the facility to generate icons from
         text files.  See docs\makewzd.txt for more information.

         Privacy improvements.  Previously, liboz-linked code would
         occasionally include random bytes from the compiling PC's
         memory.  This posed privacy problems, which should have now
         been by and large fixed, except if you use the oz*aux*()
         routines in the 48K model but your code is not big enough and
         ozlink48 gives a warning about re-linking.  To fix this
         problem, define some large initialized-data arrays in your
         program to remove the warning.  If you're not worried about
         data in your computer memory showing up in the program, don't
         worry about this.

         MODIFIED THE LICENSE IN readme.txt.  PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ
         IT SINCE IT IS LEGALLY BINDING AS SOON AS YOU USE ANYTHING IN
         THIS PACKAGE (OTHER THAN CLOCKCAL WHICH IS UNDER THE GPL).

         Brief documentation added to pix.

         Added ozgetappindexlist(), but did not document it yet.
         Subject to future revision.

         Made ozwritefile() smaller and added ozgetlastrecnum().
         Previous versions had tiny snippets of Sharp copyright code
         from the OS in them.  This has been removed.  The code for
         ozwritefile() is now much clearer.

         Added oztime(), and documented roll-over bug/problem in
         ozsec(), ozmin(), etc.  If you use these functions, see
         liboz\liboz.txt for some important information!  oztime() is
         not tested yet.

         Got rid of ozread.c from viewweek, wizterm and wiztris.
         Introduced new faster and smaller functions ozopenfile(),
         ozclosefile(), ozreadfile(), etc. for accessing Wizard built-in
         file types.

         Documented ozkeyclick().

         Serial routines overhauled.  Make sure you call ozserinton()
         before the first call to ozserialgetc() to turn on the serial
         interrupt handler and buffer now.  ozserintoff() works better
         now. New _ozserinton() and _ozserintoff() routines which simply
         control the serial interrupt at a low level, without
         controlling the handler have been added. oz?etrxhandshaking()
         routines added to control receive handshaking.

         16K model support is being deprecated now.  ozlink will now be
         synonymous with ozlink32.  The old 16K model is still available
         for special purposes via ozlink16, but it is unsupported.
         Library functions that use custom interrupt handlers will not
         work on it.  For the ordinary programmer's sake, the
         documentation no longer discusses which routines work and which
         do not.  Basically, special keyboard speed controls do not
         work, buffered serial i/o does not work, and greyscale does not
         work with the 16K model.  Since everybody will now be using the
         32K model, this should be no problem.

         zxc -z now uses the 32K model.

         KEY_BACKSPACE now equals 8, instead of the old value which was
         designed for the 16K model.  This may break some programs, but
         should be easy to fix.

11-22-01: Version 0.061

         Fixed major bug in close1() which caused junk files to be
         written for files created with open1() if the last file before
         program termination was an O_WRONLY file.  All programs using
         the open1(), write1(), close1() type routines should be
         recompiled.

         Fixed minor bug in all close*() which caused junk return
         values.

         Fixed ozsound() problem.  [LC]

         Added putchar(), printf(), ozscrolllinesclear() and ozgotoxy(),
         though did not document yet as no floating point support yet
         for printf().  Note: To use putchar(), you must either compile
         with -DOZ7XX or else include
                #define OZ7XX
         before the #include <stdio.h>, or else #include <oz.h> at the
         top of each source file using putchar().

         Fixed bug in ozslow() and ozunblankscreen().

         Added ozdelay64hz().

         Fixed bug in ozfilledbox() that did not allow y-coordinate 79
         to display.

07-14-01: Version 0.060

         Added source code for indexby program that lets you index
         telephone entries by company name.

         Integrated a grey-scale kernel into the custom interrupt
         handler and added lots of grey-scale display functions.  See
         section 1.5 of docs\liboz.txt.  They grey-scale functions need
         further testing, of course.

         Added ozfilledbox().

         After the power key is pressed in the custom interrupt handler
         or the 32k/48k mode, the atexit() functions as in previous
         versions get called before the Wizard is turned off.  However,
         now the power key is turned off after the power key is pressed,
         so that the atexit() functions don't get interrupted via a
         second press of the power key.  This only happens when the
         atexit() functions are called from an exit initiated with the
         power key.  An ordinary program exit does not disable power key
         handling.  The features described here have not been tested
         very thoroughly.  Moreover, the power key handling may come
         back on in file-writing routines as control in them is passed
         to the Wizard OS.  This is inconvenient and may cause your
         program's emergency save functions (activated on power-key
         press, say) to fail if the user presses the power key again. It
         may be a good idea to warn the user that an emergency save is
         in progress and the Wizard will turn off shortly.
         
         Changed the custom interrupt handler to disable power key
         handling after it has once been triggered.  Power key handling
         can be controlled and checked with oz?etpowerkeyhandling() now.

         Improved ozserinton() and ozserintoff().  You should call
         ozserinton() before using the ozserialgetc() function.

         Fixed some minioptimizer bugs and recompiled library.

         Added warning about float to byte-length cast bug to README.

         Fixed a bug in the (still) unsupported function ozfarmemcpy(). [PK]

         Fixed a bug in makewzd.  [PK]

         Fixed a bug in ozeditline().

         Fixed a paste bug in wizterm.

04-02-01: Version 0.051

         Fixed and improved ccopt optimizers again.  Recompiled liboz
         library.  Please re-link all projects linked against 0.050 or
         0.049 libraries.

03-22-01: Version 0.050

         Fixed and improved ccopt optimizers.

03-19-01: Version 0.049

         Added ozeditline() function for inputting a line of text.

         Improved the miniopt optimizer and added the ccopt batch file
         for compiling with it.  See readme.txt for information on how
         to use it instead of zxc.

         Added oz*repeat*() functions to control key repeat.

         Fixed bug in ctype.h (tolower() and toupper() declarations).

         Wiztris highscores added, and other Wiztris enhancements.

         Modified file routines to allow simultaneous read/write, to fix
         bug.  Now the ozfindxxxx() return logical cluster numbers.

         Fixed bug in ozclick().

         Fixed(?) a bug operative when a file is open for reading while
         another file is open for writing.

         Fixed a frommemo bug operative when file system gets filled up.

         Added sizer and wrapper programs: useful for development.  See
         sizer\readme.

         Added open1(), read1(), write1(), lseek1(), rewind1(),
         close1(), open1ro(), read1ro(), close1ro(), lseek1ro(),
         and rewind1ro() functions for memory efficient file i/o with
         only one file open at a time (and read-only for the 1ro
         variants).  See docs\liboz.txt for more information.

         Added localecho, visualbeep and keyclick options to Wizterm.

         Updated readme.txt.

         Sped up lseek() for large files.

         Fixed bug in file routines that made it impossible to have more
         than one file open at a time.

         Fixed bug in ozscroll() that made it not work in >=32k model.

01-22-01: Version 0.048

         Fixed bugs in lseek.c.

         Finished implementing auxiliary memory area functions.

         Fixed bug in makewzd.c and makewzd.exe.

12-23-00: Version 0.047

         Added CLOCKCAL software and source.  Enjoy!

         WARNING: The file writing routines might not work on European
         multilingual ZQ-7xxM models.  This includes the open(), write()
         and ozwritefile() routines.  End-users should be warned.  There
         may also be sync problems for other users--who knows?

         Fixed major bug in ViewWeek's repeating appointment generator
         and added some features.

         Fixed bug in ozputs when printing at y=80 (used to cause
         crash).

         Sped up and shortened ozdisplay*byte() routines.

         Documented quirk in backspace handling (docs\liboz.txt).

         Fixed(?) bug in file update/delete routines.  This necessitated
         a re-doing of the file formats.  As a result, maximum filename
         length for open() reduced to 23 characters.  The present
         version of the file system is incapable of reading any files
         produced with previous versions.  You will need to delete the
         old versions of the files before using this.

11-19-00: Version 0.046

         Backlight still doesn't work properly in 16k mode.

         Added ozdisplayputbyte().

         Added ozngetch(), ngetch(), oznkeyhit() and nkbhit() which are
         "nice" versions of ozgetch() and getch() that check for exit
         keys and terminate the program if necessary and also do
         backlight control.  It is highly recommended programs use these
         nice versions unless speed or memory is of essence (these
         versions are somewhat slower than the not nice ones).

         Sped up horizontal line drawing a lot.

         Added second video page support.  See gfx\bounce.c to see how
         to use this for simple animation.  See wizterm\wizterm.c to see
         how it helps implement help screens and the like.  See
         docs\liboz.txt for more information on video page access
         functions.

11-11-00: Version 0.045

         Re-did C file system--it seems to work on the 770 now, but if
         there is a lot of data in the C file system, appointments may
         not sync well together with DTO.  I don't mind since I don't
         care all that much about sync'ing my appointments.

         Fixed backlight functions, added ozgetlight() and documented
         ozsetlight().

         Implemented ozgetcontrast(), ozsetcontrast(), ozblankscreen(),
         ozunblankscreen(), ozfast(), ozslow(), ozenableinterrupts() and
         ozdisableinterrupts() in library.

         Added 12/24 hour toggle to viewweek.

         Added ozinitsound(), ozsound() and ozquiet() to library.

         Fixed major bug in ozwrite() that would cause crash in 32k mode
         when filesize was divisible by 256.  Recompiled wizterm and
         viewweek.  Fixed a bug in viewweek's annual repeater.

         Disabled alarm during 16k programs (it's probably disabled as
         well during 32k programs--not tested!) as it caused hang.
         Sorry: This will mean a missed alarm if it comes up during a
         16k program.

         Sped up ozfilexxxx() routines slightly.  Added ozfindfilename()
         for additional speed and modified file system routines to use
         it.

         Improved power-off key handling in ozcustom.as and made exit
         via battery switch ignore atexit() functions.

         Minor changes to license.

         Recompiled ozline.obj in liboz.  Don't know what was wrong with
         the old one but it crashed wiztris.

09-22-00: Version 0.042

         ozcustom() keyboard handler now repeats upper keys as well.

         Fixed floating point sprintf() and sscanf() and made them
         smaller and faster.

         Made owner setting in makewzd simpler.  See docs\liboz.txt for
         more information.

         Fixes and optimizations to file i/o routines.  open(), read(),
         write(), access() and lseek() should now work.  Removed warning
         from docs not to use open(), read() and write().

09-14-00: Version 0.041

         Added warning to docs not to use open(), read() and write() yet
         until the bugs are worked out.

         Ensured the presence of definitions of the macros _tolower()
         and _toupper() in ctype.h and made sure tolower() and toupper()
         conform to the standard.

         ZQ-7xxM support for file i/o and (hopefully) for ozputs() and
         ozputch().  PLEASE RECOMPILE ANY RELEASED PROGRAMS FOR THIS NEW
         FUNCTIONALITY.

         Revised ozinclocation() to handle files continued on other
         pages.

         Italian translation of ViewWeek.  [GG]

         Made ozline() prettier.  [ARP,DT]

         Reduced memory usage of ozfindxxxx().

09-03-00: Version 0.040

         Added open(), read(), write(), close(), closeall(), unlink(),
         unlinkallowned() functions.  **Important revisions to the
         license agreement in connection with these functions have been
         made.  See README.TXT.**

         Added atexit() to library and modified 16k.as and 32k.as to use
         exit functions.

         Added ozexitto() to library and modified 32k.as to preserve
         keyboard buffer after exit.  ozexitto(KEY_TELEPHONE), for
         instance, exits to the telephone directory.

         Added fake bdos() to init code.

         Made ozwritefile() and ozundelete() support the OZ-770 and call
         ozinitfs() when done.

         Added ozwritefile() to library.

         Changed ozfindxxxx() to support OZ-770.

08-19-00:
        Version 0.037.

         Added *recnumptr parameter to ozfindxxxx().

         Added ozunlink() file delete routine to library.

         Added ozputsgetend() to library and fixed minor viewweek bug.


         Made internal variables in ozcircsm.c static.

         Merged internal code for ozfindnext() and ozfindmemo() to
         reduce the size of programs that use both.

         Working on OZ770 compatibility issues.  See week\ozfile.as.

8-09-00:
        Version 0.036.

         Fixed file writing code in Wizterm.

         Added ozline() to library.  [DT, modified by ARP]

         Added ozcircle() to library.

         Defined a dummy close() in 16k.obj and 32k.obj.

         Replaced the multiplication routine in the Hi-Tech C library
         with a faster (but about 66 bytes longer) routine in LIBOZ.


         Replaced memcpy, memset, sprintf and sscanf with smaller and
         faster versions.  Removed more non-working CP/M stuff from
         standard library.  The sprintf and sscanf for floating point
         are unchanged.

         Fixed bugs in the library isspace().  This doesn't really
         matter since normally the macro form will be used and that
         seems OK.

         Added DOCS\MEMORY.TXT and DOCS\LIBOZ.TXT with useful
         documentation.

         Othello restored with updates.

         Minor bug-fix in c.com.

         Miscellaneous optimizations in LIBOZ.

8-02-00:
        Version 0.035.

         Othello temporarily removed due to report of it incapacitating
         someone's Wizard--caution is suggested with all other programs.


         Wizterm now has screen capture code in copy.as and copyscr.c.
         Use this as a stencil for other file-writing code.

-------:
        Version 0.034.

         Another emergency update to wizterm.

         Includes BIN\CHECKSYM.EXE for checking symbol locations.
         The ozlink and ozlink32 batch files now use CHECKSYM to
         make sure that the lowpage and highpage psects are correctly
         located.

7-29-00:
        Version 0.033.

         Emergency update to wizterm.

7-29-00:
        Version 0.032.

         Changed the zx*.exe executables so that the whole package can
         be unzipped (keeping directory structure constant) in any
         directory, not just c:\progra~1\wiz\hitech.

         Softkeys and paste support added to wizterm.

7-25-00:
        Version 0.031.

         ozputs() and ozputch() no longer call system functions, are
         faster and can be used in the 32k memory model. The older
         versions are available as ozputs_system() and ozputch_system().
         Using ozputs_system() will work only in the 16k model, and will
         be about twice as slow, but one will save some main memory at
         the expense of stack space.

         Changed README.TXT, updating information and changing the
         licensing.  YOU MUST READ THE CHANGES IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
         USING THE NEW VERSION.

         Modified compiler\stdlib.h to get around minor compiler
         warning-generator bug involving qsort().

         Replaced the standard library qsort by a faster version not
         requiring malloc().

         Modified makewzd to allow inclusion of icon file.

         Modified assembler documentation.

         Finished off the upper keyboard support in ozcustom.as.  But
         there is still no key repeat on the upper keys.

         Fixed left/right arrow key confusion again!

         Still working on file system.  See WEEK\ for a week-at-a-time
         schedule viewer that accesses the todos/schedules/anniversaries
         directly from flash.  But at least the low-level file-access
         functions ozfindmemo(), ozfindnext(), ozloadcluster() and
         ozinclocation() are now in LIBOZ and seem to work.

         The various application demos (wizterm, wiztris, viewweek
         and othello) have been updated in various ways.

7-6-00: Version 0.03.

         Removed some stuff from libc0.lib that doesn't work on the
         Wizard.

         Fixed timings in wiztris.

         Some work on graphics.  A circle drawing routine is found in
         GFX\OZCIRCLE.AS, but filled circles do not crop perfectly yet.
         Unfilled or filled-and-uncropped circles are fine.

         Added M_PI and M_SQRT2 to math.h.

         Added ozpoint() to library for plotting a single point.

         Added ozungetch() to library.

         Added the higher level keyboard input routines kbhit() and getch()
         which know about shift, capslock, ctrl and the like.

         Fixed buggy definitions of KEY_LEFT and KEY_RIGHT in oz.h and
         adjusted stuff in TERM\ accordingly.

         Working on file system.  Work in progress in MISC\.

         Fixed a bug in ozgetch.as that caused system hangs, and made
         some other refinements to it, including power saving.

         Changed ozcls.as to use ldir instead of calling the OS.

         Changed ozkey.as to fix hangs due to auto power off.

         Added -T speed optimization flag for zxc.  It doesn't do
         anything beyond -O as far as I can tell, but it's supposed to
         be there.

         Created ISR install routines ozint.as and oz_int.as, and added
         to LIBOZ.  Made the init code compatible with them.  Made
         _ozexitrestoreint() for restoring original interrupts and
         exiting.  Now can use a single init code for programs that
         use a custom ISR and for those that do not.

         MAKEWZD, 16K.AS: Made internal filename accessible to user
         programs via extern char *_ozfilename and via main()'s argv[0].
         I'm not sure this works.

         32K.AS: Added 32k memory mode.  Still in testing stage--there
         may be some *alloc() problems.  For an example of usage, see
         the OTHELLO directory, where you will find a fully functional
         OTHELLO game.

6-16-00: Version 0.021.

         Revisions to zxc*.exe allowing use of @ to pass long command
         lines to Hi-Tech programs.  This speeds up the building of
         liboz.lib.

         Modified libsrc\gen\makefile.  It now works.

         Many changes to terminal emulator in term\. [BG,ARP]

         Changed init code (16k.obj) to make more stack space available
         for programs.

         Slight speedup of Z80 emulator--about 8% improvement of compile
         times.

         Added backlight control stuff to liboz.

6-02-00: Version 0.02.

         EMERGENCY UPDATE: Fixed nasty bug in BSS initialization code
         that could cause major damage for programs that do not have a
         bss segment.

         Added -z option to compiler command line.  zxc -z hello.c now
         produces a hello.bin file that can be processed with makewzd.


         Changed initialization code so it returns directly to
         MyPrograms when a program is finished.  If you want to wait for
         a key press, add an ozgetch() call at the end of the program.
         [RJ]

         Changed B icon to C icon and made miscellaneous changes to
         makewzd.c. [MA]

5-30-00: Version 0.01.

         Fixed bug in liboz\16k.as that caused linking problems with
         ozlink.bat for programs that lacked bss/data.

         Initialization now clears bss segment, ensuring that
         uninitialized static and global variables are zeroed as
         expected.

         malloc() now should work.

         Made all library routines save IY as Hi-Tech C lets one use
         IY as a register variable of pointer type.

         Changed makewzd to check for zero-length output.

         Miscellaneous work on terminal emulator.

         Miscellaneous changes to CP/M emulator code, speeding up the
         Hi-Tech C compiler under the emulator by about 30%.

5-25-00: Version 0.00.

         Initial release.
