Hallo Mr. Pruss

of course you may convert and offer Alpha Fonts for the Sharp Wizard platform. Pleas do not rename any font and add a note like: "Alpha Fonts converted for Sharp Wizard with kind permission of Rainer Zenz (www.rainerzenz.de/palm)."
Your conversions look pretty good - please pay attention to include all characters like accents, "umlauts" etc.

As the market for Sharp Wizard seems to be quite small you may use these fonts also for shareware (with the note above). Just make a small donation - not to me and not to you ;-).

Have a nice day, Rainer Zenz
