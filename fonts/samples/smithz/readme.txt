first i thought you are developing on the sharp zaurus PDA (or 
similiar, forget that name)...
ok, your sharp is a less powerful device. i don't care.

if you would like to use my fonts, ok. give me credit somewhere and it's ok.
but i would like to see the result, especially the letter-spacing. it 
must be done correct, otherwise it looks horrible and my good ol 
fonts would be not happy then. you see i speak pidgin inglish very 
well.  :-)

creating different line-spacing variations is ok.

bzw, how do you convert them to use in your SDK. Since they're mac-fonts.

or did you cutnpaste each char of the gifs on my site ??? ...err...

cheers,
