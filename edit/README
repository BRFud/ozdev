ALPHA TEST VERSION: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This is a memo editor.  If you like it, you are invited (but not
required) to donate $8 to a pro-life organization.  (Press MENU for more
information inside the memo editor.)

If edit.h starts with
        #define FIXED
not commented out, then this compiles a fixed-width font version.

See edit.inf for instructions.

A secure text editor with 128-bit encryption is available from Alexander
R. Pruss (ap85@georgetown.edu) for $15 for residents of the U.S. and
Canada.  A demo (with encryption disabled) is available by email upon
request.
