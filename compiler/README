LIBC.LIB is the original Hi-Tech C library, slightly modified for
bug-removal purposes.
LIBC0.LIB contains changes for OZ7xx systems.

orig_h contains the original Hi-Tech .h files whenever I've had to
modify these.

DO NOT RUN ANY .COM FILES FROM THIS DIRECTORY DIRECTLY.  THEY ARE FOR
CPM.
