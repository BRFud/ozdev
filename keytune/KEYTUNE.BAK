BY DOWNLOADING YOU SIGNIFY YOU HAVE READ AND AGREED TO ALL OF THE
CONDITIONS LISTED HERE.  This is a C/assembly program.  It is possible
for a C/assembly program to damage data and even to make your organizer
inoperable.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  NO GUARANTEES ARE MADE. By
downloading this program to your organizer you agree not to hold the
author(s) responsible for any damage to data, hardware or anything else.
IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ARE
NOT LEGALLY PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD OR USE THE PROGRAM. This program may
be freely distributed but only provided that this description is
unmodified.  This program is copyright (c) 2000-2 Alexander R.
Pruss.

It is recommended you back up your Wizard before running C/assembler
programs.

NOTE: If a C/assembly program hangs due to a bug, you may need to flip
the battery switch on the bottom of the Wizard back and forth.  If the
Wizard does not respond to this, taking the batteries out for half a
minute should help.  If this doesn't help, you've read the WARNING
above.  None of this should be necessary, but no guarantees are made.

This program may not have been sufficiently tested.  Report bugs and
suggestions to: ap85@georgetown.edu.

BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:
This program lets you change key repeat settings, screen blanking times,
key click settings and other global settings for KeyTune 3 compatible
programs.  Currently, WizBook 1.8+ and MemoEdit 1.8+ are KeyTune 3
compatible, but hopefully many new released programs will be KeyTune 3
compatible.

Everything should be fairly self-explanatory, except for the following.
The "no sound" option turns off the sound-effects of a program (if the
program supports KeyTune).  The "extra key after blanking" option means
that when the screen blanks, the keystroke you press to unblank the
screen is ignored by the program--by default, it gets passed on to the
program and executed as in PC screen savers.  You can type in times in
seconds, or in minutes or in hours.  Just put "s" or "m" or "h" after
the time you type in.  If you omit the units, they are assumed to be
settings.  You enter "0" to turn off a feature.

NOTE: Any alarms going off while KeyTune is running will be missed.  The
auto power-off won't work either.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION: This program is written in Hi-Tech C, with some
assembly bits for i/o.  Source code will eventually be available in the
latest Wizard Hi-Tech C distribution on www.ozdev.com under "win32
downloads".
